Coordinate-Ascent
=================
Implementation of a basic Coordinate Ascent (same thing as Coordinate Descent, just 'reversed'), as well as the Lasso implementation.

## Modules
This repository has basically 4 modules:

* Class to Synthesize data
* Coordinate Ascent
* Coordinate Ascent with Lasso
* File to test everything

## Requirements

* Python 3.x (3.3 recommended)
* Numpy >= 1.7
* For comparison with Lars: scikit-learn >= 0.14
